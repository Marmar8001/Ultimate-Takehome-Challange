# Exploratory Data Analysis, Experiment Design, and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains code and analysis for three parts: Exploratory Data Analysis, Experiment Design, and Predictive Modeling.

## Part One: Exploratory Data Analysis
The file `logins.json` contains simulated timestamps of user logins in a particular geographic location. The code aggregates the login counts based on 15-minute time intervals, visualizes the resulting time series of login counts, and identifies important features such as daily cycles. The code also explores login counts by hour, day, month, and day of the week. Any data quality issues are reported.

## Part Two: Experiment Design
The file `ultimate_data_challenge.json` contains data related to user signups and trips. The goal is to encourage driver partners to serve both Ultimate Gotham and Ultimate Metropolis. The code proposes using the percentage of average time each driver spends in each city as the key measure of success. It describes a practical experiment design, including waiving toll costs, conducting the experiment in different seasons, and using a one-tailed z-test to verify the significance of the observation. Recommendations and caveats are provided.

## Part Three: Predictive Modeling
The dataset provided represents a cohort of users who signed up for Ultimate accounts in January 2014. The task is to predict rider retention and identify the best predictors for retention. The code performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. A predictive model is built to determine whether or not a user will be active in their 6th month on the system. The chosen approach, alternatives considered, concerns, and model validity are discussed. Key indicators of model performance are included. Suggestions for leveraging insights to improve rider retention are provided.

Please refer to the individual code sections for detailed explanations and implementation steps.
